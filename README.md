# PyBer_Analysis
 
## Overview
* We are doing exploratory analysis for PyBer and will use multiple python tools to assist us in gathering trend data and showing it appropriately.
## Results
* We calculated the fare per ride and fare per driver averages and put them into a dataframe by city type.

* We created a line chart that shows the data accross the timeline to look for trends

## Summary
1. Urban cities appear to have less fares per ride, probably due to shorter routes. We should look into distances for our next study.
2. There are more drivers than rides in Urban cities indicating we may excess drivers and should find ways to increase rides or decrease drivers.
3. Maybe to offset from the shorter distances of urban rides we should increase fares to try to gain income.
